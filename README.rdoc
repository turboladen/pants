== DESCRIPTION:

Pants redirects IO using {http://rubyeventmachine.com EventMachine} from one
input source to many different destinations.  In some senses, pants is like a
*nix pipe that allows for duplicating data across many pipes (like splice and
tee).

== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

All readers can write to any other writer:
* Read/write UDP unicast data
* Read/write UDP multicast data
* Read/write Files
* Pluggable: write your own reader or writer


The amount of data you can replicate really depends, of course, on system
resources.  On an i7 MacBook Pro with 16GB RAM and 2 wired NICs, I've been able
to duplicate a single 720p video + audio stream over unicast UDP 200 times (pushing ~1.4
Gbps out) with almost no quality loss on client ends.  If you plan to duplicate
more than 20 streams, you'll need to start tweaking EventMachine thread pool
settings; generally you should set EventMachines +threadpool_size+ to the number
of output streams so it can process all of the data concurrently.  If you're on
OSX or *nix, you might benefit from using EventMachine's .epoll and .kqueue
feature.  More on that {http://eventmachine.rubyforge.org/docs/EPOLL.html here}.

File reading/writing also depends on many factors, such as the number and size
of files, disk capabilities, and general I/O capabilities of your system.  If
you'd like to benchmark, there's a {Thor}[http://whatisthor.com] task in
+tasks/+ that will compare pants to FileUtils.cp and `cp` in copying a file
some number of times (default to 100).

Example:

  $ tasks/pantsmark.thor file_copy some_song.mp3 --times=50


== SYNOPSIS:

=== As a library

Read unicast UDP inbound data and write to a number of other unicast UDP clients:

  pants = Pants.new('0.0.0.0', 1234) do |seam|
    seam.add_writer('10.0.0.10', 1234)
    seam.add_writer('10.0.0.11', 1234)
    seam.add_writer('10.0.0.11', 2345)
  end

  pants.run

Read multicast UDP inbound data and write to a number of other unicast UDP clients:

  pants = Pants.new('239.0.0.1', 1234) do |seam|
    seam.add_writer('10.0.0.10', 1234)
    seam.add_writer('10.0.0.11', 1234)
    seam.add_writer('10.0.0.11', 2345)
  end

  pants.run

Read unicast UDP inbound data and write to a UDP client and a file:

  pants = Pants.new('0.0.0.0', 1234) do |seam|
    seam.add_writer('10.0.0.10', 1234)
    seam.add_writer('socket_data.raw')
  end

  pants.run

Read a file and send out via UDP:

  pants = Pants.new('socket_data.raw') do |seam|
    seam.add_writer('10.0.0.10', 1234)
    seam.add_writer('239.0.0.1', 1234)
  end

  pants.run

=== As an executable

The examples from above can also be run via the command-line app like this:

  $ pants udp://0.0.0.0:1234 --destinations=udp://10.0.0.10:1234 udp://10.0.0.11:1234 udp://10.0.0.11:2345
  $ pants udp://239.0.0.1:1234 --destinations=udp://10.0.0.10:1234 udp://10.0.0.11:1234 udp://10.0.0.11:2345
  $ pants udp://0.0.0.0:1234 --destinations=udp://10.0.0.10:1234 file:///home/me/socket_data.raw
  $ pants file:///home/me/socket_data.raw --destinations=udp://10.0.0.10:1234 udp://239.0.0.1:1234

== REQUIREMENTS:

* Rubies (tested)
  * MRI 1.9.2
  * MRI 1.9.3
  * JRuby 1.7.0
* Gems
  * eventmachine (>=1.0.0)
  * log_switch
  * thor

_NOTE:_ Multicasting with JRuby doesn't seem to work; EM fails to allow setting
socket options, which is necessary to do multicasting.

== INSTALL:

* (sudo) gem install

== DEVELOPERS:

After checking out the source, run:

  $ bundle install

This task will install any missing dependencies, run the tests/specs,
and generate the RDoc.
